# workspace

demo project
porting the kernai-kotlin-maven project to vanilla js, vanilla cs (maybe sass or postcss)
yarn workspaces (don't really need it for this one)
typescript
nodemon for hot reload

this is really just a platform for learning about 
1. nodejs on the back end (sql databases, rest api's)
2. practicing modern vanilla javascript (mainly crud forms), no spa framework involved
3. practicing vanilla css
4. trying code sharing across projects using yarn workspaces

features include:
define views on the server, via some admin panel, in a file/database
then send to client, and client renders based on view definition (could possibly code generate pug views)
plain vanilla javascript front end code, for example responding to modern browser events in forms and controls etc
might get some ideas for a framework out of it
get the useful apps going, logins, recipes, notebook, contacts- to try out all data inputs, including dates
maybe use the google closure library?
